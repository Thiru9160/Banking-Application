Key Components

Java AWT and Swing:

AWT: Used for basic GUI components and event handling. It provides the foundation for creating user interfaces in Java.

Swing: Built on top of AWT, Swing offers a richer set of GUI components, such as buttons, tables, and forms, which enhance the visual appeal and user experience.
Database Management:

SQL: Used to interact with a relational database (e.g., MySQL, SQLite) for data storage and retrieval. SQL statements are executed to perform operations like creating tables, inserting records, and querying data.
